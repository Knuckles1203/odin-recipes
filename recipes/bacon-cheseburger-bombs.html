              <li> 1 teaspoon sea salt</li>

            <h4>Steps:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 375&degF. Line a baking sheet with 
                    aluminum foil.
                </li>
                <li>In a medium bowl, combine the ground beef, garlic powder,
                    onion powder, salt, and pepper and mix until combined.
                    Use a spoon or small cookie scoop to divide the mixture
                    evenly into 9 balls and roll in your palms to smooth.
                </li>
                 <li>Flatten each ball and place a cube of cheese in the 
                     center. Form the meat around the cheese, sealing it and 
                     rerolling in your palms.
                 </li> 
                 <li>Wrap each ball with a slice of bacon and place it on
                    the foil-lined baking sheet.
                 </li>  
                 <li>Bake for 30 minutes or until the beef is cooked through
                     and the bacon is crispy.
                 </li>
                 <li> Serve immediately or store in an airtight container in the
                      refrigerator for up to 3 days.
                 </li>
