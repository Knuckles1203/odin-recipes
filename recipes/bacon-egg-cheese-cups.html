            <ul>
                <li> 8 bacon slices</li>
                <li> 3 tablespoons salted butter</li>
                <li> 10 eggs</li>
                <li> 2 teaspoons sea salt</li>
                <li> 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li> 1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese</li>
            </ul>

            <h4> Steps:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 375&degF. Line a baking sheet with
                    parchment paper and place the bacon on it. Cook for 15
                    minutes, flipping at the halfway point.
                </li>
                <li>Meanwhile, grease a 12-cup muffin tin throughly with 
                    the butter. 
                </li>
                <li>In a large bowl, whisk the eggs until beaten. Add the salt,
                    pepper, and cheese. Whisk until combined. Divide the 
                    mixture evenly atop each egg cup.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Remove the bacon from the oven. (It should be about three-
                    quarters cooked at this point.) Chop into small pieces
                    and sprinkle evenly atop each egg cup.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bake for 10 to 13 minutes or until browned and set.
                    Cool for 1 to 2 minutes on a wire rack before removing
                    the egg cups from the tin. (You may need to run a knife
                    around the edges to help get them out.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Serve hot or store in an airtight container in the 
                    refrigerator for up to 3 days. 
                </li>
